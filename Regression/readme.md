# Regression Analysis

This folder contains notebooks and data for exploring and comparing different regression models.

## Files and Folders

*   **`Compare Linear vs Polynomial Regression (Degree 2) .ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook comparing linear regression and polynomial regression (degree 2) on a simple dataset.
*   **`compare_models_california.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that likely compares different regression models using the California Housing dataset.
*   **`housing.csv`**: The dataset file, likely the California Housing dataset, used in the notebooks. The data can be found at [Kaggle: California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).
*   **`readme.md`**: This documentation file.
*   **`Linear Regression/`**: This folder contains notebooks specifically focused on Linear Regression.
    *   **`California Housing Dataset.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook applying linear regression to the California Housing dataset.
    *   **`simple-example.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a simple linear regression example.
*   **`Polynomial Regression/`**: This folder contains notebooks specifically focused on Polynomial Regression.
    *   **`California Housing Dataset.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook applying polynomial regression to the California Housing dataset.
    *   **`simple-example.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a simple polynomial regression example.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2.  You might need to install common data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. You can typically install these using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```
3.  Open the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the different regression analyses.
